    <p class="bio-text">Miles Morales' development in "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse" is 
      a central aspect of the movie. At the start of the film, Miles is a regular teenager trying
       to adjust to his new school, but the bite from a radioactive spider drastically alters his life.

  <div class="bio-container">
    <p class="bio-text">Initially, he struggles with his new powers, 
      lacking control over them and failing to live up to the expectations 
      set by the original Spider-Man. He's also dealing with grief over the 
      loss of Peter Parker, who was a figure of inspiration for him.

    <p class="bio-text">Through his encounters with other Spider-people 
      from different dimensions, each with their own unique approaches 
      to heroism, Miles learns important lessons about what it means to be a 
      hero. Particularly influential is an older, more cynical Peter B. Parker 
      who becomes an unwilling mentor to Miles.
    </p>

  <div class="bio-container">
    <p class="bio-text">Miles deals with self-doubt and the pressure of 
      living up to the Spider-Man legacy. However, through courage, 
      resilience, and a process of self-discovery, he eventually 
      comes into his own. He learns to master his powers, including 
      his unique abilities of invisibility and bio-electric venom shock.

    <p class="bio-text">By the end of the film, Miles fully embraces 
      his role as the new Spider-Man, proving himself a worthy successor 
      to the mantle. He manages to save his city from Kingpin's dangerous
       collider and helps the other Spider-People return to their respective 
       dimensions. The film ends with Miles confidently accepting his role as 
       the protector of his city, cementing his transformation into Spider-Man.
